# Dataview: WIP
Just playing around with random libraries and containerization
The .env file in this repo is not really full of secrets, they're just throw-aways. However, if you fork this repo add the .env to your .gitignore file.

# Notes
Due to issues with PDO and PHP8 I'm having issues using PDO to attempt to test a connection, so you might want to switch to MySQLi or something else to test the db connectivity.
This project is just for my personal edification of PHP8, and not meant as anything else, but by all means follow along.

# ToDo
Wiki - write docs on creating and containerizing a PHP project
Includes: Twig, Bootstrap, Monolog, Doctrine, Subshine
